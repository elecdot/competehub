# Configure Git Before Committing

Set Git to normalize line endings to `LF` before your first commit. This prevents platform-specific `CRLF` changes from being introduced, especially on Windows.

```bash
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
```

>[!warning] This does not mean the `CRLF` (Windows style line endings) is permitted .
